##Welcome to the OWASP Seattle Chapter!

## Meetings and Events

### Security Social Lunch Hours
At noon on the 2nd Wednesday of every month we host a social meeting on Zoom with mini talks and breakout rooms.  The main room will always be open for social time but we plan to have 1-2 topic breakouts you can join.  If the breakout session topic interests you, join that discussion.  Feeling more like a casual chat and exploring other topics, visit the main room to strike up a conversation.


Suggest topics you’d like to see breakout rooms for and let us know if you’d like to sign up to lead one.

Message the group with your thoughts @ [seattle-chapter@owasp.org](seattle-chapter@owasp.org) or on [Slack @ #chapter-seattle](https://join.slack.com/t/owasp/shared_invite/zt-g398htpy-AZ40HOM1WUOZguJKbblqkw).
